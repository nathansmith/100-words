# 100 Words Intro

Fellow internet traveler:

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, and welcome.

This page is a "who am I" intro paragraph in exactly 100 words.

It was an assignment for ADES 5410, a class at the University of North Texas.

That is part of the core curriculum for the MA in Interaction Design program.

Our professor wanted students to produce a roughly 30-second animation, and showed this Warby Parker video as an example.
